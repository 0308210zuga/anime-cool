Anime is distinguished by a characteristic manner of drawing characters and backgrounds. It is published in the form of television series, as well as films distributed on video media or intended for film screening. Plots can describe many characters, differ in a variety of places and eras, genres and styles.</h3>

<b>The animation of Japan differs from the animation of other countries, first of all, in that it is a developing closed cultural layer, which includes many unique plot and ideological symbols, templates, stereotypes and types. The simplest examples are genres specific to anime, like mecha, that live by their own laws, or elements of Japanese culture that are often reflected in anime.</b>

<b>Children, watching anime characters, adopt certain patterns of behavior from images that are close to them. Most likely, the reason for this influence is that after returning to the real world after watching the anime series, the child sees a discrepancy, and this develops frustration in him.</b>

<b>The first and most important stage is the search for an idea and money for its implementation. Long before drawing the first frame, the creators come up with their own plot or take a certain manga or game as a basis. By the way, money plays a fundamental role in the production of anime, so the initiator of the creation of a series or film is, as a rule, a studio or a company that promotes its product. For example, it takes an average of 150-300 thousand dollars to create one episode lasting twenty-five minutes.</b>

<b>Anime, like other video productions, is created with a particular distribution in mind[57][58]. These methods include showing on television, in cinemas, selling on video media, distribution via the Internet.</b>
<p></p>
<b>A movie is an anime intended to be shown in a cinema. As a rule, these are full-length (from 60 minutes) films, which are distinguished by a higher quality of animation compared to other formats and, accordingly, higher production costs.</b>
<p></p>
<b>ONA (Original Network Animation) "animation created for the Internet" - an anime specially created for distribution on the Internet. Works created as ONA are still very rare, and usually their duration is short. An example of this format is the 4-minute add-on to the Azumanga Daioh series: Azumanga WEB Daioh</b>

<b>The transfer of emotions in anime is an occasion for a separate discussion. In addition to the traditional for anime types of manifestation of feelings by a character - a change in facial expression or tone of voice, a number of other techniques are used. Emotions can be depicted in an emphatically unrealistic, exaggerated way - the characters speak with their eyes closed to convey peremptoryness, or take on a picturesquely demonic appearance when they show anger.</b>
<p></p>
<b>In comedy situations, in order to show the frivolity of feelings, pictograms are used, such as a picture of “droplets of sweat” or “swollen veins” that appear on top of the hero’s head, or in a frame above it.</b>
